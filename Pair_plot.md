**Pair Plot in Seaborn: A Simple Overview**

The **pairplot** function in Seaborn is used to plot pairwise relationships in a dataset. It's great for visualizing how different features of a dataset are related to each other, especially when you want to see correlations between multiple variables.

In the example below, the dataset `tips` is loaded using `sns.load_dataset("tips")`. This dataset includes information like the total bill, tip, sex, smoker status, day, time, and size of the party.

### Code Breakdown

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np

# Load the dataset
var = sns.load_dataset("tips")

# Pair plot with customization
sns.pairplot(var, hue="sex", hue_order=["Female", "Male"], x_vars=["total_bill", "tip"], kind="kde", diag_kind="hist", markers=["*", ">"])

plt.show()
```

### Explanation:

- **Dataset**: We're using the `tips` dataset that comes with Seaborn, which contains 244 rows and 7 columns (including total bill, tip, sex, smoker, etc.).
- **hue**: By using the `hue` parameter, we can differentiate data points based on a specific feature (like "sex"). In this case, we separate the data into "Female" and "Male".
- **x_vars**: This allows you to select which columns to plot on the x-axis. Here, we are plotting only `total_bill` and `tip`.
- **kind**: The `kind` parameter determines what type of plot is shown. We use `"kde"` (Kernel Density Estimation) in this case, but you can use `"scatter"`, `"reg"`, or `"hist"` as well.
- **diag_kind**: Controls the plot shown on the diagonal. We've set it to `"hist"`, but it can also be `"kde"`.
- **markers**: The `markers` parameter specifies the marker style for different categories. In this example, `"*"` for female and `">"` for male.

### Key Points to Remember:

1. **Works with numerical data**: The pairplot function is designed to work with numerical columns in the dataset.
2. **Customizing with hue**: The `hue` parameter helps us highlight certain groups in the data. In this case, it distinguishes between males and females.
3. **Selective columns**: You can choose to visualize only specific columns by using the `x_vars` parameter.
4. **Types of plots**: The `kind` parameter lets you decide the type of plot for pairwise relationships: scatter (default), kde, reg, or hist.
5. **Diagonal plots**: You can customize the diagonal plots to show either histograms or KDEs using the `diag_kind` parameter.

This simple example demonstrates how to visualize relationships between `total_bill` and `tip` and differentiate them by gender. You can modify the columns, plot types, and other parameters to fit your analysis needs.
